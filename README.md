1. Software packages requirements
The python code is included in ipynb files. The code is independent from operating systems.
The user should install python3. Relevant packages that are required include jupyter notebook, numpy, scipy and matplotlib. 
The authors have tested the code on MacOS, using python 3.8.5, jupyter core 4.6.3, jupyter notebook 6.1.3, scipy 1.5.2, numpy 1.19.1, and matplotlib 3.3.1.
There is no requirement for other non-standard hardware.

2. Installation guide
Users can use "pip" command to install the above mentioned python packages, for example, 
pip install jupyter
pip install scipy, etc.
The installation typically won't last longer than half an hour.

3. Demo
All the code in the notebook can be executed immediately. We provided demon run with outputs in separate cells in ipynb files. Demon runs are labeled with hashtags "# demo example".

4. Simple guide for usage
To start the ipynb files, on linux/MacOS, users can work from command line terminal. First, navigate to the directory where the ipynb files are located. Then, on command line type "jupyter notebook" and select the relevant ipynb file.
On Windows, users can also launch from the terminal.
